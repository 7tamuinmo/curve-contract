## What's New in Revit 2017?
 
Revit 2017 introduces several improvements and innovations that make it easier to create and edit models, collaborate with others, and produce high-quality documentation and visualization. Some of the key features include:
 
- **Global Parameters:** You can now define parameters that apply to the entire project, such as dimensions, materials, or formulas. You can use global parameters to drive values across multiple elements or views, ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout your design.
- **Depth Cueing:** You can now add depth to your elevations and sections by applying a gradient to the background. This helps you create more realistic and expressive drawings that convey the spatial relationships of your building elements.
- **Text Editor:** You can now edit text more easily and efficiently with a new text editor that supports rich text formatting, spell check, find and replace, and more. You can also import text from Microsoft Word documents or other sources.
- **Railing Enhancements:** You can now create more complex and customized railings with new options for hosts, placement, and profiles. You can also edit railings in 3D views and sketch freely to create curved railings.
- **Rebar Improvements:** You can now model rebar more accurately and efficiently with new tools for rebar constraints, rebar sets, variable rebar distribution, free-form rebar shapes, and more. You can also create rebar shop drawings with customizable annotations and schedules.
- **Dynamo Player:** You can now run Dynamo scripts directly from Revit without opening the Dynamo interface. This allows you to automate tasks, optimize workflows, and enhance your design capabilities with minimal coding skills.
- **Performance Enhancements:** You can now work faster and smoother with Revit 2017 thanks to various performance improvements, such as faster opening and syncing of large models, better memory management, improved graphics rendering, and more.
