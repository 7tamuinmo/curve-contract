## How to Use HRD 5.0b Build 2893
 
Once you have downloaded and installed HRD 5.0b Build 2893, you can start using it by launching the HRD icon on your desktop or start menu. You will see a window that asks you to select your radio model and COM port. You can also choose to enable or disable some options, such as auto connect, auto update, and auto start DM780. After you click OK, HRD will try to connect to your radio and display its frequency and mode on the main window.
 
The main window of HRD has several tabs that allow you to access different functions and settings. The most important ones are:
 
- **Rig Control**: This tab lets you control your radio from your computer. You can change the frequency, mode, power, filter, and other parameters by clicking on the buttons or sliders. You can also use the mouse wheel to tune the frequency or adjust the volume. You can also store and recall frequencies in memory channels, scan for signals, or use macros to perform complex commands.
- **Logbook**: This tab lets you log your contacts and keep track of your QSOs. You can enter the call sign, name, QTH, grid square, and other information of the station you contacted. You can also look up callsigns on QRZ.com or other online databases. You can also export or import your logbook to various formats, such as ADIF, Cabrillo, or Excel.
- **DM780**: This tab lets you use digital modes, such as PSK31, RTTY, CW, SSTV, and more. You can decode and encode signals using your sound card and interface cable. You can also use macros to send standard messages or customize your own. You can also log your contacts directly from DM780 to the logbook.
- **Satellite Tracker**: This tab lets you track the position and status of various satellites that are of interest to amateur radio operators. You can see a map of the world with the satellite's footprint and path. You can also see the azimuth and elevation of the satellite relative to your location. You can also control your radio and rotor to automatically tune and point to the satellite.
- **Rotator**: This tab lets you control your antenna rotator from your computer. You can enter the azimuth or elevation of the direction you want to point your antenna to. You can also use presets or a compass to select a direction. You can also calibrate your rotator or set limits for its movement.

HRD 5.0b Build 2893 is a powerful and versatile software suite that can enhance your amateur radio experience. It can help you control your radio, log your contacts, use digital modes, track satellites, and rotate your antenna with ease and convenience.
