## Maria Goretti's Legacy: A Model of Forgiveness and Holiness
  
Maria Goretti's heroic virtue and martyrdom did not go unnoticed by the Church and the world. She was beatified by Pope Pius XII in 1947 and canonized by him in 1950, becoming the youngest saint at the time. Her canonization was attended by a huge crowd of over half a million people, including her mother Assunta, who was the first mother to witness her child's canonization, and her attacker Alessandro, who had become a penitent and a devout Catholic. [^2^]
  
Maria Goretti is venerated as a patron saint of purity, rape victims, young women and youth. Her feast day is celebrated on July 6, the anniversary of her death. Her relics are preserved in a basilica in Nettuno, Italy, where many pilgrims come to pray and honor her memory. Her story has inspired many books, films, songs and artworks that depict her courage, faith and love.
  
Maria Goretti's example challenges us to live with more holiness and grace in our daily lives. She shows us how to resist temptation, defend our dignity and forgive our enemies. She also teaches us how to trust in God's mercy and providence, even in the midst of suffering and death. She invites us to follow her motto: \"It is a sin! God does not want it!\" [^1^]
  
As Pope Pius XII said at her canonization: \"Maria Goretti was not content with saying 'No' once or twice; she continued to say 'No' up to 14 times; she did not think of herself but of God whom she loved and wished to love more every day.\" [^3^]
  
Let us ask for her intercession and guidance as we strive to imitate her virtues and love for God.
